# No Man's Sky Assistant Languages
### Language "packs" for the No Man's Sky Assistant App

This repo holds the json files used to display the app in different languages. I only know English, Afrikaans and a tiny bit of French. So your help will really be appreciated!!.

Everyone that contributes will be mentioned on [the App's website](https://nomanssky.kurtlourens.com "No Man's Sky Recipe website"). If you do not want to be featured on the website just let me know 😁.
